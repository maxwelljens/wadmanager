This is not a complete project. It's just something I was doing in Perl, before
I realised I am not too fond of Perl. It has interesting advantages, but I feel
like the disadvantages are too large to ignore.

Nevertheless, putting it here in case anybody ever wanted to see an attempt at
a CLI-based WAD manager for DOOM made in Perl.
